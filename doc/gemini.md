# Gemini Development Policy

## Frontend Type Checking

Before building or committing changes to the frontend (`webapp/`) directory, it is a mandatory policy to run type checks locally to catch errors early and ensure code quality.

To run type checks locally:

```bash
cd webapp
npm install
npm run typecheck
```
